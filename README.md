# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Data Science Specialization Coursera Johns Hopkins University

Introduction

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

    Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]

    Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

    1.Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
    2.Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
    3.Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
    4.Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
    5.Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
    6.Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
    7.Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
    8.Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
    9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
    
  *Tasks*
  Preprocess data:  to fork and clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1 in my working      directory. Then 
  1. To load dataset "Electric Power Consumption" from  UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository Website
  2. To wite a R code to create plots that prescribed in the assignement to examine how household energy usage varies         over a 2-day period in February,2007. PNG plots will be created by using R codes.
